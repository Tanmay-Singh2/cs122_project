# CS 122 Project: Airline Traffic Data and Air Traffic Analysis

## Authors:

## Description:

Through this project, we aim to design an interactive Python-based application with a custom GUI designed to analyze and visualize real-time air traffic data using the OpenSky Network. The interface would enable users to access live web data from the OpenSky Network data. Our plan is to scrape the web data and locally organize the aircraft information for further analysis (in potentially csv files). The application aims to focus on three core analytical components: comparing air traffic patterns between major cities and states, detecting congestion levels near busy airports, and identifying air traffic volume trends over time. Through easy-to-understand visualizations such as heatmaps, line charts, and interactive maps, the tool will provide users with insights into global airspace dynamics. 

## Project Plan and Outline:

### Interface Plan (Tanmay Singh and Khushi Chandra)

For the Interface plan we plan on using the Tkinter library of Python and develop a python GUI framework. The GUI will offer an intuitive and user-friendly layout where users can input locations (cities or states), select time ranges, and choose analysis modes such as traffic comparison, airport congestion, or volume trends. Through the GUI, we aim to implement real-time updates and refresh functionality to ensure the interface remains current without overwhelming the user with data. Additional interface features may include dropdowns for selecting airports, buttons for toggling between visualizations, and a dynamic map display for viewing aircraft positions and congestion zones in real-time (not super sure about the full layout yet).

### Data Collection and Storage Plan (Tanmay Singh)

For the Data collection and storage plan, I will be collecting data from the OpenSky Network using their REST API and Python client. The application will pull real-time flight data based on important parameters such as National boundaries and airport codes. I aim to scrap the data at regular intervals and organize it locally using CSV and JSON files. I will also be using the Pandas DataFrames in Python to store and work with the flight data files, so I donâ€™t have to keep calling the API calls every time I need something. I will also keep important details like timestamps, origin countries, altitude, and speed to help my teammate better analyze how things change over time. If needed, I might also save historical data locally to track trends and patterns more effectively.
